82 VERGILI AENEIDOS XI

690. Orsilochum et Buten] A verb is readi] y understood
from what precedes—-‘ next Orsilochus...she slayS.’

691. aversum] Some explain ‘in flight‚' but it apparently
means that she came upon him while he was turned in another
direction, striking him from the left side where the neck
‘shone’ between the cuirass and the back of his helmet.
sedentis, ‘as he sat (on horseback),' seems hardly consistent
with the idea of rapid fiight.

694. Orsilochum...] Editors are very obscure in explaining
this device. Apparently Camilla lures Orsilochus to pursue
her and (1) gallops in a large circle, theu (2) by checking her

speed and bringing her horse round 011 a small inner circle ⁷

(yyro interior), while Orsilochus is still carried forward‚ she comes
behind him ‘pursuing the pursuer‚' and (3) strikes him down
with her axe. It would be easy ‘to perform the feat on skates
by suddenly changing a large curve into a loop.

696. perque arma...perque ossa] The emphatic repeti-
tionkof both preposition and copula marks the strength of the
stro 'es.

697. oranti et multa precanti] The assonance imitates
the continued iteration of his prayer3 cf. 10. 554 orantis
nequiquam et 'multa parantis Ι clleere; 4. 390 malta ‘metu
cunctantem et multa parantem Ι dicere. Prayer follows prayer,
but she only ‘ redoubles (the blows of) her axe.’

701. haud...] ‘not the meanest of the Ligurians while fate
still permitted him to deeeive‚⁷ 226. in life he was the craftiest
of his race. Fallere is put rhetorically almost παρὰ προσδοκίαν
for vivere .· the Ligurians were noted liars (Cic. pro Cluent. 26).

702. evadere pugnae] ‘to escape from the combat'3 the
dat. is the same as that after verbs of ‘taking away sr01n,' ag.
adimo, eripio. Usually evado is followed by a proposit-ion, or
by the acc. or abl.

703. avertere] active; he sees that he cannot ‘turn the
queen from her onset' ; cf. Livy 22. 15 hostem (avertere. Some
make it intransitive (as verto and its compounds sometimes are),
‘that the queen does not turn aside.’

704. consilio...] ‘essaying to plot guile with eounsel and
craft’3 versare dolos (cf. 2. 62; 4. 563) describes ‘turning
over' a device in the mind.

705. femina forti fidis] Scornful alliteration.
