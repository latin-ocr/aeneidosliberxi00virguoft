INTRODUCTION XiX

As a story of war and adventure the Aeneid cannot
compete in freshness and life with the Iliad and the
Odyssey. It could hardly do so. Between the bard
who chants the ‘glory of heroes' at the feasts of
warrior chiefs in a primitive age and the studious

natural growth‚ the other an artistic creation. The
one describes men who live and breathe as they
appeared to men of like passions in their own day 3

of the past, and make them interesting to men whose
thoughts, tastes, and tempers are wholly different.
