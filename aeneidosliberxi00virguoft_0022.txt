xviii INTRODUCTION

with a refusal, and a council is held in which his rival,
Drances, bitterly attacks Turnus, but which is broken
up at the news that the Trojans are attacking the city.
Turnus hurries to the fray‚ and is joined by Camilla,
with whose story the latter half of the book is occupied.

Book XII., after several minor episodes, relates how
Aeneas and Turnus at last meet in single combat, in
which the latter is slain.

The Aeneid, it will thus be seen, is a sort of
national epic intended to connect the origin of the
Romans (and especially of the Julian family) with
the gods and heroes of Homeric song, and incident-
ally serving to dignify many Roman customs and
ceremonies by identifying them with the customs
and ceremonies of the heroic age. At the same time
Aeneas and his foHowers, as through difficulties and
dangers, putting their trust in heaven, they steadily
press forward to success, afford a visible personification
of those virtues which had slowly and surely secured
for Rome the empire of the world, while Aeneas
himself ‘as a fatherly ruler over his people, their
chief in battle, their law-givet in peace, and their
high-priest in all spiritual relations‚' ¹ is clearly a type
of Augustus, the founder of the new monarchy.2

² Nor is it unreasonable to sec in Dido a type of those
seductive charms coupled with unfeminine ambition which the
Romans dreaded and detested in Cleopatra.
