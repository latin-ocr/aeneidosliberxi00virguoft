Alexander Severus thus consulted the Sortes 767·θὶ-
lionae, and opened at the words Aen. 6. 852 tus φέρεν-6
imperio populos, Romane, memento, while Charles I.
in the Bodleian Library at Oxford came upon the
famous lines Aen. 4. 615-620 :

In considering Virgil's writings, it must be borne
in mind that, with the exception of satire, Roman
poetry is entirely modelled on Greek. Terence copies
Menander, Lucretius EmpedocleS, Horace Alcaeus and
Sappho, Propertius Callimachus, and so on. Virgil
in his Eclogues professedly imitates Theocritus, in his
Georgics Hesiod, and in the Aeneid Homer. The
cultured circle of readers for whom he wrote would
probably have turned aside with contempt from a
poem which relied wholly on native vigour‚ and did
not conform, at any rate outwardly, to one of the
accepted standards of literary excellence. They
relished some happy reproduction of a Greek phrase,
which was ‘ caviare to the generaL’ much in the same
way that English scholars sometimes dwell with
peculiar satisfaction on passages of Milton which it
needs a knowledge of Latin to appreciate. Horace
