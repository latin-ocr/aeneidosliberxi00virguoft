tected by armour ‘that there (qua=ut ea) he may direct a
deadly wound.'

750. sustinet...] ele. tries to hold up the hand of Tarchon,
who is endeavouring to thrust the spear—head into his throat.
vim viribus exit, ‘seeks to evade force with force.’ Vis is
usually ‘ violence’ and vires ‘strength‚' and some consider that
the distinction holds here, but the assonant phrase is meant to
empliasise the equal fiercene'ss of the two combatants. To
render vim by one word and viribus by another is fatal. Exire,

which is intransitive ‘to go out‚' is allowed, like many other ’

verbs (eg. evadere), to take an aee. in a seeondary sense=‘to
escape fromss ‘avoid’ ; cf. 2. 438 tela emit.

751. utque...] ‘and as a tawny eagle in lofty flight carries
off a snake...but the serpent wounded writhes its sinuous folds
...while she (the eagle) no less (i.e. in spite of its efforts> assails
it struggling... z even so (757) Tarchon... .'

753. Note the alliteration.

to sting the eagle.

hour was come.’ For slaying Camilla he was himself to be
slain by Opis, ef. 590-2, 853 seq.

760. prior] This diffieult word seems to go closely with
the two words multa arte between which it stands Arruns
hovers round with his javelin and much craft, being superior
(ef. pietate prior 292) to her in this last point. Camilla was
reekless (cf. 781), Arruns crafty‚ and this gave him the ad-
vantage, though he was no match for her in fight.
