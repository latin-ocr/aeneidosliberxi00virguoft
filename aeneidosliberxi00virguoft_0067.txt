1. interea] ‘meantime' The last thing mentioned at the
end of Book X. is the slaying of Mezentius on the previous day,
so that interea is not used strictly, but as a vague particle of
transition ; cf. 182 ; 10. 1 panditur interea (lomus omnipotentis
Olympi, in both which cases it introduces the events of a fresh
day. virgil is fond of the word at the beginning of a paragraph,
cf. 532 597.

For ’a summary of the Aeneid, showing at what point in the
story this Book opens, see Introd. pp. xiv seq.

2. quamquam...] Aeneas had two duties to perform, (1)
to ‘bury his eomrades’ and (2) to ‘pay his vows to the gods'
after his victory. But the presence of the dead involved
ceremonial uncleanness; hence he might have been expected
‘to give time to their burial’ first, as his own ‘care irnpessed'
(praecipitant curae), and then to perform his vows when freed
from pollution. Roman ritual, however, prescribed that in
such a dilemma the offering to the gods should be performed
first (si contingyeret, uc uno eodemque tempore ct smzestarelm· quis
et coqerecm· operam dare sacrificiisselabm'abat ut ante sacra
compleret quam funus aquosaeret .· Servius), and therefore Aeneas
so acts in spite of his inclinations. The ‘paying his vow’
consists in erecting a trophy to Mars as described 5-11. dare :
the inf. is dependent on the general sense of praecipitant
curae, which expresses ‘desire’ et...que: a very rare com>
bination for ‘ both ...and.'
