56 VERGILI AENEIDOS XI

(2) ‘ for Asia's defeat lay in wait the paramour ’ ; the assassin
awaits in his lair the completion of the conquest so that
he may strike in the very honr of triumph.

For (1) subsedit Acestes 5. 498, used of the lot of Acestes re-
maining at the bottom of the helmet, is quoted, and the reading
devicta Asia mentioned by Servius is in its favour; but (2)
seems better to suit the ordinary use of subsidere (Sil. It. 13.
221 subsidere Zeonem; Lucan 5. 227 subsidere requiam), while
subsessor ‘ a lier in wait’ is several times used of an adulterer.

Nearly all editors say that clei-ictam Asiam is = rictorem Asiae,
but surely if Virgil wanted to write παίω-67η Asiae subsedit
adulter, he could have done so, and the line would be perfectly
clear and good. His point, however, is not the person (though
of course the person is implied) bnt the point of time for which
the assassin waits. The very essence of tragedy often consists
iu the particular moment when the blow falls—‘ When haughty
power mounts high, The watcher's axe is nigh’——and Virgil
understood this, but his critics will not let him have his way. .

The explanation that subsedit: ‘ sat as ἕφεδρος’ (tle. the third
combatant who sat waiting to fight the one of two others who
should conquer) has no authority, and would certainly require
victorem Asiae.

269. invidisse deos...] ‘that the gods have begrudged my
seeing. ...‘ The construction of invidisse is dubious : it may be
(1) an exclamation, ‘to think that...'; but when the inf. is so
used (eff. 1. 37) there is usually some particle marking an ex-
clamation to introduce it ; or (2) we must carry on ‘referam from
264, ‘shall I say that... 2’ or (3) we must move lines 264, 265
and place them after 268. The construction invidisse ut viderem
is almost without parallel and mustzinv. lzoc, ut vid. ‘have
begrudged me this, nam-sely, that I should see.’

272. et] explanatory3 cf. 75, 207. There were various
stories about these birds which haunted certain islands—
Diomedeae insulae—off the coast of Apulia 3 see Conington and
Hevne.

275. haec adeo...] ‘Such‚ such indeed was the doom Ι had
to expect even (iam) from that fatal (illo) hour....’ The
emphasis is marked; the moment the deod was donc already
the punishment was sure. For haec adeo cf. 314 n.

276. cum...] Venus intervened iu battle to save Aeneas,
and was wounded in the hand by Diomede, Hom. Il. 5. 318 seq.
