256. mitto ea...] ‘I pass hy the sufferings endured in war
beneath (those) lofty walls, the heroes whom that Simois
covers.’ Exhazmffre ‘to drink to the end,’ ‘to the dregs,’ is
often used with words like laam-es, periculaz‘go through ’ς
and so here absolutely. ille: either ‘that samous’ or ‘that
distant.'

259. vel Priamo...] ‘a host that even Priam might pity?
Priani's own woes (Πριαμικαὶ τύχαι) were famous, and he owed
them all to the Greeks3 yet even he might pity their plight.
scit, ‘can bear witness! Minervae sidus: storms and the
weather generally were continually associated with the rising
and setting of certain stars, and so here Virgil boldly speaks of
‘Minerva’s baleful star‚' meaning the storin sent by Minerva
(zPallas) on the Greeks as they were returning from Troy
(see 1. 39). Above all many perished at the promontory of
Caphareus at the SE. of Euboea, where Nauplius the king
hung out false lights (Ov. Met. 14. 472, 481).

saw....

262. Protei columnas z ἵζε. Egypt and the island of Pharos,
over which Proteus was king, see Hom. Od. 4. 354. The
phrase is chosen to suggest a contrast with ‘the columns of
Hercules’ at the other end of the world. The famous ad-
ventures of Ulysses with the Cyclops Polyphemus are told in
the ninth book of the Odyssey.

known of their settlcnient in Africa.

threshold ’ ι the moment he crossed it.

268. devictam Asiam subsedit adulter] Two different
explanations may be given of this highly rhetorical phrase—

amour’ ; first the triumph, then the assassin’s stroke.
