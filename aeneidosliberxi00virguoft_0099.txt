soldier's death—, but if (419)... .'

415. si solitae...] ‘if aught of wonted valour were with us
still, he (were) methinks held happy in his struggle (cf. 476)
and glorious in his spirit who rather than see (i.e. live to see)
such sight...) mjhi is the dative. fortunatus laborum:
cf. 73 laeta laborum, and animi is probably here parallel in
construction, though it may be, as often, locative.

418. humum...] ‘once for all bit the dust’; semel marks
that his sufferings would be ended, while those who lived lived
on to suffer still. Cf. for the phrase Homer’s ὀδὰξ ἕλεν οὖδας,
ὀδὰξ λαζοίατο Ὑαίαν.

420. auxilio...supersunt] lit. ‘are left us for a help,’ ‘are
left as a support.'

425. multa...] ‘many things have time and the changesul
labour of the varying years brought back to happier state,
many, revisiting them in shifting guise, has Fortune (first)
mocked and (then) set up again upon a rock.' The first half
of the sentence refers to what human effort may do, the second
to what may be looked for from fortune. varii: because the
difference of conditions etc. which time brings gives human
effort an opportunity for making things better. mutabilis:
probably activezqui mutat. alterna: explained in the sol-
lowing line.

431. delectos Latio] ‘the chosen troops,’ ‘the flower of
Latium’s arrny.’

433. florentes aere] ‘in bravery of brass.’ This curious
phrase is also used 7. 433 of Camilla’s troops, and seems clearly
chosen to describe the brilliant appearance of these maiden
soldiers, decked not with- jcwels but with arms.
