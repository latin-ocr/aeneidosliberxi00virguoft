at death 11115 ⁴ breath ’ is scattered and rejoins its kindred ‘ air.’
Cf. 4. 705 in ventos vita προπίῃ Shaks. Rich. 111.‚1. 4. 37—-

‘ The envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To seek the empty, vast, and wandering air.'

619. reiciunt parmas] The shield is thrown back over⁵
their shoulders for proteotion ; cf. 630.

620. agunt] ‘ drive them before them,’ like sheep ; ‘ pursue.’

621. iamque propinquabant rursusque tollunt]
Notice the change of tense—‘and now they were nearing the
gates ‚when (lit. ‘and') suddenly the Latius raise the war-
cry....

622. mollia] ‘yieldi11g.' colla: 50. equorum.

623. hi] ‘They‚' 120, the Trojans. penitus: with referun—
ίιιν,· the adverb suggests the idea of retreat into shelter 01·
into a liiding-place.

624. qualis ubi...] The alternations of the battle are
compared not to the ebb and flow of the tide—our ‘tide of
battle' might mislead—but to the alternate advance and retreat
of the waves when the sea is breaking 011 a coast. Each charge

of horsemen is like the advance ot‘a wave in which there are ’

three movements, first its downrush (ruit), then its flinging
itself in foam over the rocks which bar its path, and lastly the
gradual loss of power as it spreads fan-like (sinu) over the sand ;
then 101ῂ1011ἑὶ5 the rapid retreat, excited at first and then settling
lnto a s ea y sweep.

Notiee the 3- sounds, as of the surge, in the first two lines,
contrasted with the liquids in the second two, while in these
latter the first line marks trepidation, the second smoothness.
The four lines (625—628) are a marvel of skill.

630. respectant] of the looks of terror which they cast
behind them as they fly.

632. inplicuere] ‘ interlocked ’3 emphatic, there is no
separation possible now. legitque virum vir: in contrast to
totas inplicuerc acies, and added to bring out the grim nature
of the struggle ; each man has marked his opponent, they close
‘man to man.’ The rhythm is also intended to give force.
The phrase recalls Hom. Il. 15. 328 ἔνθα δ’ ἀνὴρ ἕλεν ἄνδρα,
where however ἕλενΞ ‘ slew‚’ not ‘ ehose’ (εἵλετο).
