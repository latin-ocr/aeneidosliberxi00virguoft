NOTES 63

it was Latinus who was really cowed by Turnus, but Drances
judiciously speaks of the universal terror he inspires, and in-
cludes himself (cf. obtestemur ‘let us entreat ³),

358. ipsum...ab ipso] In bitter irony. Ipse is constantly
used by servants z ‘the master‚' or by disciples of their teacher (as
in ipse dimit), and implies supreme and unquestioned authority.

359. ius proprium] Certainly, considering the irony
throughout, this should be taken ‘let him give up his own..
due rights in favour of king and country.' Of course they
were not his rights ε king and country had thc real right to bc
considered in the bestowal of Lavinia’s hand, but to render
‘let him give back to king and country their due rights' spoils
the sarcasm.

362. nulla...] ‘no safety (is there) in war : 'tis peace we all
claim...and with it the only inviolable pledge of peace.’ bello 3
pacem: antithetical juxtaposition.

364. invisum] ‘thy foe’ or ‘rival' et esse nil moror:
parenthetic ; ‘ and my being so (or not) I dismiss.' Nil moror
is continually used with the acc. of something to which the
speaker is indifferent or with which hc wishes to have nothing
to do, and so too sometimes with an infinitiv.e Here Drances
say:s ‘You imagine me your lival; I have no wish to be so,
aud the question of my being so is 1118181 ant in sace of the
fact that Ithlou my self as a suppliant at ι10111 feet.' Some
explain‘ I do not object to be so‚' ‘I care not if I am' ; but
(1) this 111-01111 tone is contrary to the context, and (2) how can

m'l moror, which describes ραι-81883 dismissal, also express ready
acceptance 2

366. pulsus abi] ‘defeated quit the field’; a bitter refer-
ence to his supposed ssight (350 11).

369. dotalis regia] ‘the dower of a kingdom'3 a sneer—it
i‘sisng‘talior Lavinia but her dower that he cares. cordi est:
372. animae viles] ⁴ worthless liv es.¹

373. etiam tu]‘ do thou also’ ; in strong contiast to nos.

sihqua tibi vis: the rare monosyllabis 0ending expresses
ve emence.

374. 11111111...]ζ look 711771 111 the face, who ‹hallengcs thee)
For aspice contub cf Hom. 11. 19.15 ἄντην εἰσιδέειν and Con-

ington quotes the chrew phrase‘ to look each other in the
face, ' 2 Kings xiv. 8.
