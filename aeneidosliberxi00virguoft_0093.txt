of that braqyart who is our bane. Do thou, O Χίης, not be
wanted, bat add 07ae ‘more to tlte gyzjfts thou art sending] to Aeneas,
and offer him thy dauqhter’s hand. Or, if terror prerents this,
let us address our champimz. with cntreaty. We all pray to thee,
Turnus, and I, thy rival, am chy schplia‘nt. Have pily on our

The speech of Drances, with its malignant sarcasm and
rhetorical devices, is in admirable contrast with the simple
dignity of Latinus and the wal-like ‘ violence¹ of Turnus.

336. tum Drances] The verb is surqz't 342, the sentence
being interrupted by the long parenthesis 338-341. idem in-
fensus, ‘with the old (cf. 220) hatred.’

337. obliqua...] ‘ disquieted with the poisoned stings of
side-glaucing envy.' Envy rankles in the heart to which it
allows no rest, and finds expression in the eye (whence its name
invidia, from in and video) which ‘looks askance' on the success
of others.

338—341. A parenthesis descriptiva of the character of
Drances. Some only mark 9671ch huic...fcrebat as parenthetical.

338. largus opum] ‘lavish of his wealth'3 adjectives ex-
pressing plenty or want regularly take the genitive. frigida
bello: ‘sluggish for war'3 the opposite os vivida bello 5. 754,
‘ quick for war.’

339. futilis] vasfutilc was a vessel used in the rites of Vesta,
which, having nothing to stand on, could not bc set down

without spilling (fundo) its contents ; hence sutilis contemptu-
ously osone who has nothing in him.

341. incertum...] ‘from his father he derived it (his yenus)
doubtful²; he did not know who his father was. virgil de-
scribes him as illegitimate, half-prend and half-ashamed of his
birth, in order to give a clue to the jealousy of his character.
Some take serebat ‘ he bore the burden of doubtful birth.’

343. rem...consulis] ‘thou dost ask (us) for counsel on a
matter...’ ; consulo can take two accusatives, (1) of the person
consulted, (2) of the subject about which he is consulted3 cf.

Plaut. Men. 4. 3. 26 consulam hanc rem am‘z'cos; Cic. Att. 7.
20. 2 mec te id σοφιςιιῐο.
