XX INTRODUCTION

Roman, in whom reverence for the gods (pietas) and
manly courage (virtus) combine, and who therefore
ultimately achieves what he aims at in spite of
‘manifold mischances and all the risks of fortune.'1
Indeed throughout the Aeneid he is so regulated by
‘fate‚⁷ visions, and superintending deities that it is
hard to take any real interest in his acts and doings.
But he is not only unreal and uninteresting3 he is
displeasing. Sum pius Aeneas is how he introduces
himself,2 and all through he goes about with that
painful adjective ostentatiously tied round his neck,
doing what he ought to do and saying what he ought
to say from first to last. Once only he exhibits
human frailty, and then it is to show that as a human
being he is contemptible. He accepts the love of
Dido and then abandons her to despair and death.
There is no need to emphasise his crime3 Virgil
himself has done that sufficiently. The splendid
passage (4. 305-392) which describes the final inter—
view between Aeneas and the queen is a masterpiece.
To an appeal which would move a stone Aeneas replies
with the cold and formal rhetoric of an attorney.

Fox, a warni admirer of virgil, but who describes Aeneas as
‘always either insipid or odious.’
