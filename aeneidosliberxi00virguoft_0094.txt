62 VERGILI AENEIDOS XI

345. quid fortuna...] ‘what course the public fortune sug-
gests,⁷ lit. ‘offers-ff So elsewhere res, tempus, causa fert, but
virgil specially loves to join ferre with fortuna (the power that
‘brings’ good and ill) for the sake of assonance. sed dicere
mussant: ‘fear to speak'; musso expresses the lialf-audible
talking to himself of a person afraid or hesitating and in doubt,
ef. 454, and so here takes an inf. like a verb of fearing. In 12.
657 mussat rex ipse Latinus, Ι quem vocet it expresses doubt.

346. det...] The nom. is not expressed, mention of the
name of Turnus being avoided with great ‘rhetorical effect’
(Sidgwiek). flatusque remittat: ‘and abate his full-blown
pride'; πνέω and πνοή are common in Greek in connexion
with pride.

347. auspicium infaustum] ‘ill-starred leadership.' It
was the duty of the imperator to take the auspicia (hence au-
spiciam osten: ‘leadership’)‚ and a general whose ‘auspices’
were usually unfavourable, if he had in addition a ‘baneful
temper' (mores sinistros, ef. violentia 354, 376), was not likely
to be popular.

348. An effective parenthesis. The speaker imagines Turnus
starting up with his hand on his sword, and assures him that
he will have his say in spite of threats.

349. lumina ducum] ‘glorious leaders! Great men are
often called lamna civitatis, yemis, Graeciae, etc„ just as we
talk of ‘lights of science.⁷ Cf. too Disraeli’s phrase ‘men of
light and leading.⁷

350. dum...armis] Note the contemptuous alliteration.
fugae fidens : Jnno, in order to save his life (10. 659 θεῖ-1.), had
lured hirn from the field in pursuit of a shadowy image of
Aeneas. et caelum... : descriptive of a braggart. So a con-
ceited boxer (5. 377> verberat ictibus auras; cf. 1 Cor. ix. 26.

352. unum etiam] ‘one more.’ Unum is strongly emphatic

by positi0n; sce too its repetition in the next line. ‘Very
many' (plurima) are the gifts, but one is wanting.

354. ulliusquszermg cf. 376; but allusion is always more
bitter than direct attack. vincat, quin. . .: ‘prevail so that thou
shouldest not. ...’

356. des pater] closely connected, ‘ give as a father has the
right to do.’ Some destroy the point by making it a vocative.

357. mentes et pectora] ‘(our) minds and hearts'3 the
plural because here Drances addresses the assembly. Of course
