NOTES 57

280. nec veterum...] ‘nor have I joy in the recollection of
past ills.’ The gen. malorum is mainly dependent on memini,
but it is also partially dependent on laetor: ‘find joy in‚' cf. 73
laeta laborum„ and the Greek εὐδαιμονίζειν τινὰ τῆς τύχης ‘to
hold a man happy in his fortune)

282. tela aspera] The combat between two champions begins
with the hurling of spears (tela), then they advance to close
quarters (conferre rnumum). The words qucmtus...hastam refer
to these two divisions of the combat in inverted order (‘ Chias-
mus'). The battle is described Hom. Il. 5. 239-317.

283. quantus...adsurgat] ‘how huge he towers on to his
shield! The phrase is highly graphio. Aeneas, as he comes to
close quarters, draws himself up to the sull height of his heroic
stature, and at the same time throws his weight ‘on to his
shield‚’ which is used not merely as a defensive but as an offen—
sive weapon (cf. 12. 712, 724) to over-bear the opponent. Cf. 9.
749 consumit in ensem. turbine torqueat : imitative allitera-
tion ; ‘whirl‚' ‘hurls.'

286. ultro...] Cf. 2. 193 ultro Asiam ‘maqno Pelopea ad
moenia bello Ι venturam„ Ultro, from ultra, is often used osan
act which goes beyond what might reasonably be expected. So
here the Trojans would not be content with defeating the Greeks,
but would go farther and attack them in their own country.

287. Dardanus] Dardanus was a king of Troy: then the
word is used as an adj. z ‘ Trojan,' and so here ‘the T1·ojan‚’ ele.
the Trojans. So Romanus commonly=‘the Romans‚' Poenus
‘ the Carthaginians,' etc.

288. quidqmd...cessatum est...victoria...haesit] ‘ What-
e'er delays besell...'t was by the valour of Hector...that the
victory of the Greeks was checked and driven back. ...’ quid-
quid cessatum est: ‘ as regards the delays’ 3 the construction
is the same as that of quod superest 15.

292. pietate prior] and therefore more favoured by the gods,
and so more invindble, than Hector.

293. qua datur] ¹ as is permitted ' ; the words imply that it
was in their power, by the will of heaven, to make peace, and
that they must not neglect the opportunity. Servius (followed
by Conington) explains quacunque ratione pcrwm'ttz'tur: ‘ as best
ye can‚’ ‘no matter on what terms‚’ but this cannot be got from
the Latin. concurrant z after cavete, ‘ beware of their meeting.'
