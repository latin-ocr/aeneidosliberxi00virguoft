attendant ’ of Diana (cf. famulam 558).

547. fugae medio] ‘in the midst of his flight‚’ i.e. so as to
bar his ssight. The poets often use neuter adjectives as
substantives3 cf. 335 consulit in medium ‚· 428 rettulit in

of its banks,’ ‘ brim full!

550. omnia...] ‘as on the sudden he pondered (lit. ‘ turned
over') every plan in his mind, at last (vix) the resolve was
fixed.’ subito expresses that the emergency was sudden, vix
