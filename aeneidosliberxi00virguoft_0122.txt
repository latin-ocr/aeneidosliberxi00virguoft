ef. 5013 here the wmd marks her lack of power.

829. paulatim...] The soul or personality is eonceived as
closely inteitu med with the body y, a-nd at death has to disen-
tangle itself3 cf. 4. 697 qaae Zuctczntem animam ozewosqiae vesol-
verat (cr-tas, Luer. 2. 590 vitales animae nodos a corpore solvit.

831. vitaque...] From Homer's description of the death of
Hector (Il. 22. 362)—
ψυχὴ δ’ ἐκ ῥεθέων πταμένη Ἀιδόσδε βεβήκει,
ὃν πότμον Ὑοόουσα, λιποῦσ’ ἀδροτῆτα καὶ ἥβην,

which shows the force of indignata; the soul ‘ehafes' at the
idea of dying in youth. Virgil oloses the Aeneid with the same
line, deseribing the death of Turnus.

832. ferit aurea clamor sidera] The same phrase occurs
2. 488, where the night on which Troy was taken is being
described, and the eontrast between the ‘ golden stars' in
heaven aiid the death and dismay on earth is very effective.
Here, however, the pietmial aurea seems distinctly out of ,
place in the daytime. ε 2 ’ ” Δ

836—867. Opis marks Camilla’s death and, after Zamentiozq
it, promises lzcr veuqecmce. Accordinqu she aliyhts οη the

‘zancarcd for.

836. iamdudum...sedet] ‘sits all the while‚‘ i.e. has been
sitting ever since the command she received from Diana, 587 seq.

839. multatam] Two words, ‘mulco ‘to belabour,' ‘ beat
with a eudgeL’ and multo, often spelt maleto, ‘fine‚’ ‘punish‚’
are frequently confused, and some here read mulcatum, but there
is no authority for its use: ‘slain.’ On the other hand that
Camilla should be ‘ punished with death,' that her punishment
should be death, is a natural expression.
