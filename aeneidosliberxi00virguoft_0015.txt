in his treatise on Poetry (l. 268) lays down the law
which was considered universally binding on all poets:
ros e.⁷.·empla7·2'a Graeca
nocturna versate manu, versate diurna ‚-
and Seneca (Suas. 3) tells us that virgil borrowed
from the Greeks ozon surripiendi causa, sed palam
imitandi, hoc animo ut vellet aclqnosci.

Τ11θ Bucolics (Βουκολικά ‘songs about herdsmen')
consist of ten short poems commonly called Eclogues
(zze. ‘Selections ⁷) and belong to the class of poetry
called ‘pastoraL' They are largely copied from
Theocritus, a Greek poet who flourished during the
first half of the third century B.C.‚ and who, though
born at Cos and for some time resident in Alexandria,
spent the chief portion of his life in Sicily. His
poems, called ‘Idylls' (Εἷδύλλια) or ‘small sketches‚'
are descriptive for the most part of country-life and
often take the form of dialogue. Their origin is to
be traced to that love of music and song which is
developed by the ease and happiness of pastoral life
in a southern clime (Lucr. 5. 1379 seq), and to the
singing-matches and improvisations common at village
feasts‚ especially among the Dorians who formed so
large a proportion of the colonists of Sicily. The
Idylls, however, differ from the Eclogues in a marked
manner. They are true to nature 3 the scenery is
rea1; the shepherds are ‘beings of flesh and blood ' ¹ 3
