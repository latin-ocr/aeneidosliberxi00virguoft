NOTES . 51

191. spargitur...] From Hom. ΙΙ. 23. 15 δεύοντο ψάμαθοι,
δεύοντο δὲ τεύχεα φώτων Ι δάκρυσι.

192. it caelo...] ‘heavenward rises the cry of heroes and
the call of elarions ² 3 notice the assonance in clamor andelauyor.
caelo : virgil is fond of this use of the dat. for in with acc. 3 cf.
194 iqni=i7z iynem; 87. 205 tem-<10:272 terram ,· 206 urbi,-
594 11 ; 6. 126 descensus Averno.

195. ferventes] ‘glowing’ (lle. as they revolve); cf. Hor.
Od. 1. 1. 4 metaque fervidis erz'tata rotis. The epithet is out of
place here where they are motionless and soon to ‘glow'
literally in the fire. nota: probably ‘well-known ' as having
belonged to the dead, see next line. It may however:
‘ regular,' ‘ eustomary.'

200. semiusta] The e is long (cf. Greek ἡμι-), so that i
must be treated as semi-consonantal=y. So elsewhere semi-
animus, semiesas, but some write scvmsta, semanimus, semesas.
servant: ‘ watch,’ ‘keep ward over.’

202. invertit...] ‘ o’erturns the heaven studded with blazing
stam) The heaven is regarded as consisting of two hemispheres‚
one bright and the other dark but studded with stars, and
these hemispheres revolve, bringing day and night. Cf. 2. 250
vertitur interea caelum ; Milton Par. Lost 9. 52 ‘ night’s hemi-
sphere had veil’d the horizon round.’

203—224. The Latius also burn or bury their dead, and, in
their 9rief, their zcrath against Turnus riscs; some, however,
defend him, while the favour of the queen and Izisfcmze in war
also afforcl kim> proice-tion.

205. terrae infodiunt] Burial was as common as burning
in early Rome. virgil seems here to say that of the better-
known dead many—who it is presumed came from a distance
and could not be sent to their homes—were buried on the field,
others were ‘removed’ (avecta) and borne ‘ to the neighbouring
fields ’ (zze. to their houses in them) 01· to Laurentum (urbi) ;
the general mass of dead were burnt on the spot.

207. cetera, confusaeque...] que here introduces an
explanatory phrase (cf. 75), ‘ the rest, a mighty beap os undis-
tinguishable slaughter, they burn unreekoned and uuhonoured?
Numero and honore are modal ablatives used almost as adverbs.
Numero does not so much mean that they were not ‘ counted‚’ as
that they were ‘ held of no account ' ; Conington quotes Caesar
B. G. 6. 13 hominum qui aliquo sunt ‘numero atque honore.
