‘viola is generally explained by ‘the wall-flower’ (λευκόὶόν) and
mollis of the ‘soft ’ ‘ smooth delieacy' of colour. We may render
here, however, ‘tender violet,' as the nature of the ssower is
uuiniportaut. The ‘hyacinth' is almost certainly a lily, pos·
sibly the Martagonlily. languentis: ‘drooping‚' ‘withdrooping
head! Virgil is fond of allowing Greek words like hyacinthus,
cyparissus, hymenaeus at the end of a line, and the final syllable
os lanquentis is made long by ictus ; cf. 111 11.

the construction may be the same as line 62.

77. arsurasque...] ‘and (with the other) robe veils those
looks the fire (zze. of the funeral pyre) will claim.' One robe
was clearly wrapped round the corpse, the other laid over it.

78. Laurentis praemia pugnae] ‘prizes from the Lauren-
tiau battle' ; ἵζε. the battle against Turnus, who leads the Latin
host. Laurentum was the capital of King Latinus.

in 81, 82, to be consumed on the funeral pyre 3 cf. Hom. Il. 23.

tendants, arms, etc., in the under-world. spoliaverat: se.
