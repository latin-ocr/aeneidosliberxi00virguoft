[n the opening lines of the third Georgic Virgil
had already announced his intention of attempting a
loftier theme and producing a great national epic, of
which Augustus should be the central figure, and the
Emperor himself is said to have written to him from
Spain (27 ΒΩ.) encouraging him to publish the poem,
which he was known to have in hand, and which
Propertius a year or two later heralds as ‘something
greater than the Iliad? 2 While he was engaged on
its composition in 23 B.C., Marcellus, the nephew and
destined heir of Augustus, died, and Virgil intro·
duced into the sixth Book the famous passage (860-
887) in which he is described, and of which the story
is told that when the poet recited it in the presence
of Octavia, the bereaved mother fainted away.3 In
20 B.C. he visited Greece and met Augustus, who‘
was returning from Samos, at Athens, whence he
accompanied him homewards, but his health, which
had been long weak, broke down, and he died at
Brundisium Sept. 22, 19 Rc.

can suppose that there were two Virgils thus dear to Horace.
