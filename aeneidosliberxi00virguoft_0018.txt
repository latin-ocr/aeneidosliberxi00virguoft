with any practical aim. The characteristic indeed of
the Georgics is their consummate art. They are
written with slow1 and elaborate care. Each line
has been polished to the utmost perfectiori, or, to use
a phrase attributed to Virgil‚2 ‘ licked into shape like
a bear’s cub.' The Aeneid is conventionally spoken
of as Virgil⁷s greatest work, and, possibly, the dramatic
power of the fourth Book and the imaginat-,ive grandem·
of the sixth surpass anything in the Georgics, but
as a monument of his literar-y skill they stand un-

The Aeneid consists of twelve books, and is an

constitutes a Roman Odyssey and Iliad in one.

Book Ι. rel-ates how Aeneas, a Trojan prince, son
of Venus and Anchises, while sailing with his fleet

any one take the first Georgic and examine the exquisite finish
of rhythm exhibited in lines 27, 65, 80, 85, 108, 181, 199, 281-
3, 293, 295, 320, 328-334, 341, 356, 378, 388, 389, 406-9, 449,
468, 482. There is nothing like it in the Aeneid.
