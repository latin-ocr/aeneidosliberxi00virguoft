is used instead of a very strong affirmative one. cf. 45 ‘non
haec: ‘ very different’ ; 64 haud seyne& 152 3 238 haud laetam
452 non mollibus ; 725.

28. abstulit...] ‘a black day carried off and plunged in
bitter death.' Dies atri in the Roman calendar were unlucky
days, marked with black, on which no legal business could be
transacted. A white stone or a white mark, on the other
hand, makes a lucky day3 cf. Cat. 68. 148 quem lapide illa
diem candidiore nocem,- Pers. 2. 1. Acerbus is regular of
‘premature⁷ death. The line is repeated from 6. 429.

29—58. Aeneas returns to his tenc, where the mourners are
lwmentiny over Pallas. At the siyht of me corpse he eries, ‘Fortuna
has yrzcdqed thee to me, mzhappy boy, in. the v'ery hour qs triumph.
Far different from this was the promise I made thy unhappy
sire, who even now, per-chance, is offerinq up to heaven his vows
sor thy safely. And yet not dishonourahle is thy death and
hem-y indeed thy Zoss.’

29. limina] zle. of his house (cf. 36 foribus altis ,· 38 reqia),
not tent, for the Trojans had erected something more permanent .
than a camp (cf. 9. 782 muros, moenia, urbem, used with
reference to it). The word is used strictly, for it was customary
after the corpse had been duly ‘laid out’ (positum ε cf. 2. 644)
on the bier to place it in the vestibule with the feet pointing to
the door (cf. Hom. 11. 19. 212 κεῖται ἀνὰ πρόθυρον τετραμμένος·
ἀμφὶ δ’ ἑταῖροι Ι μύρονται).

31. servabat] ‘watchedff senior: merely ‘old’3 the word
is commonly ‘used with a certain positive soree for one who
has become old.'—Kennedy. Parrhasi-6 Euandro : notice the
hiatus and the spondee in the fifth foot. virgil allows himself
this license only in connexion with proper names, and only
three times, viz. here, 1. 617 Dardanio Anchisae, and 3. 74
Neptuno Aegaeo. These lines are generally said to be imitations
of Greek rhythm, but though hiatus in the fifth foot is common
in Homer (6.9. Il. 1. 1. Πηληιάδεω Ἀχιλῆος) and though spondaic
endings are also common (6.9. Ἀτρείδαο, Πηλείωνα), yet they
{arely consist of a trisyllabic word, and if they do there is no
iiatus.

32. sed non...] ‘bnt he went not then with like happy au-
spices (zze. as when he had gone to war as Evander’s squire),
assigned as guardian to his dear ward.’ For comes and datus
cf. 9. 648 tum comitem Ascanio patens addidit used of Butes, who
