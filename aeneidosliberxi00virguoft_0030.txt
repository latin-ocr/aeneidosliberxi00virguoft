Thou that see'st Universal

Nature moved by Universal Mind ;
Thou majestic in thy sadness

at the doubtful doom of human kind 3

Light among the vanish‘d ages ,²
star that gildest yet this phantom shore ;

Golden braueh amid the shadows,
kings aud realms ‘chat pass to rise no more ;

Now thy Forum roars no longer,

fallen every purple Caesar’s dome—
Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm

sound for ever of Imperial Rome-

and the Rome of freemen holds her place,

sunder’d once from all the human rece,

Ι salute thee, Mantovano,

I that loved thee since my day began,
Wielder of the stateliest measure

ever moulded by the lips of man.
