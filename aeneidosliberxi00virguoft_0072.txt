40 VERGILI AENEIDOS XI

44. victor veherere ; 45 promissa parenti ; 46 discedens
dederam ; 47 mitteret, magnum, metuens moneret]
Alliteration to express strong emotion.

45. non haec] ‘not these,¹ ile. far different 3 Litotes, cf. Hor.
Od. 1⁴. lo. 32 non hoc pollicitus, ‘having made a very different
promise.

47. mitteret.. .]‘ sent me forth to win great empire.'

49. ille quidem.. .51 nos] κεῖνος μὲν.. ἡμεῖς δέ. Latin very
rarely inserts‘ but in the second of two conti ‘isted clauses, but
simply sets them side by side and mark 3 the contrast by the

emphatic position of the contrasted welds. spe...: ‘much

50. fors et vota facit] Probably rightly explained by

of the origin of the idiom must be supposed lost, so that sors
becomes a simple adverb:‘perchance,' and here it is quite
possible that virgil means ‘ pei-chance he even makes vows.'

11 em. c. 6—

¹ Ο father, whereso’er thou be,
That piedgest now thy gallant son—-
A shot, ere half thy (lraught be (lone,
Hath stilled the life that beat from thee!

51. nil iam...] ‘who now owes naught to any of the gods
above.' The father makes vows which, had his son lived, would
have had to be paid, but heaven has now no claim 011 either of
them. caelestibus also suggests that Pallas has now passed
into the realin of the 0⁷13 inferi.
