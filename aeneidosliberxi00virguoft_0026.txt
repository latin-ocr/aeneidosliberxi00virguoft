is a master of melodious rhythm, and he is a master
of literary expression. The Latin hexameter, which
in Ennius, the father of Latin poetry, is cumbrous
and uncouth, and in Lucretius, though powerful and
imposing, still lacks grace and versatility, has been
moulded by Virgil into a perfect instrument capable
of infinite varieties and responsive to every phase of

impossible to read ten lines anywhere without coming
across one of those felicitous phrases the charm of

man of deep though controlled feeling. He is a
patriot who loves his country with a love ‘far brought
from out the storied past,⁷ and his pride in her
imperial greatness animates the whole poem and lives
in many a majestic line.1 He has pondered long and
painfully on the vicissitudes and shortness of human
life, but his sadness (which some have censured as
‘pessimism '), while it lends pathos to his style, never
degener-ates into despair, and the lesson which he
draws from the certainty of death is the necessity of
actionF' He is deeply religious and a firm believer
