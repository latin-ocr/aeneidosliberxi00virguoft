a divine shield for Aeneas, 8. 368 θέᾳ, as in Il. 18. 368 seq.
he had done the same for Achilles at the request os Thetis.

440. socero] By this word Turnus indicates that he main-
tains his claim to Lavinia’s hand.

442. devovi] ‘I have devoted? A leader ‘devotes' his life,
when he solemnly dedicates himself and the enemy's army to
destruction and tlleQflings himself upon the foe until he is cut
down: the two Decii (340 and 295 B.C.; see Livy 8. 8; 9. 4)
are famous instances. Of course Turnus does not mean that
he ‘devotas’ himself in this strict sense, for he clearly hopes
for ‘same and victory,' but devoveo to a Roman ear would
certainly suggest a reference to the practice.

443. nec...] ‘ nor let Drances rather (than myself), if herein
is heaveu’s anger, appease it by his death, or if 't is victory and
fame, wiu it,' te. whatever the issue of this struggle, death or
victory, Ι claim to be your champion.'

Litotes ; cf. 22 n.

453. arma...arma] The repetition imitates the repeated
eries, cf. Hor. Od. 1. 35. 15 ad arma, cessantes ad arma 1 concitet.
Of course ‘arms’ means not actual arms but the chance for
using them—‘wan‘ fremit arma, ‘ cries “war.’'' manu:
pictorial; their ‘excitement’ (trepidi, cf. 300 n) shows itself
in their gestures. Virgil is fond of adding manu to the de-
scription osan act (1) pictoriassy, and (2) to emphasise the per-
sona] effort. For (1) cf. 332; for (2) 116, 484, 650, 816, 893.

454. elamor...] ‘the din in confused dissonanee rises... ';
