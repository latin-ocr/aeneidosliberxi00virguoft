NOTES 45

107. prosequitur venia] From its usez‘escort a guest'
on his departure as a mark of honour (cf. 92 n.)‚ prosequor
acquires the general sense of ‘deal courteously to‚’ ‘hon0ur‚'
and. prosequi benevolentia, Zaza‘lz'bus, 711ise)·z'cordicc‚ etc. are
common in prose. So here Aeneas honours them by conceding
the favour they sought.

108. indigna] ‘ unworthy’ of you, and so, as often, = ‘ unde-
served,‘ ‘crueL’

109. qui...fugiatis] qzaezsszut vos, ‘so that ye Hy!

110. sorte] Notice the politeness οῖ’ the word: itis only
‘by the chance of war' that they have fallen.

111. oratis? equidem] The last syllable of oratis is
lengthened by ictus aided by the pause. equidem: though
this word is only. philologically, a strengthened form of quidem
and may be used with all three persons, yet Virgil always uses
it with the first as if it werezeyo quiderm. So here—‘do ye
pray me for peace for ‘che dead...] would gladly grant it to the
living ἵοο.1

112. nec veni, nisi...declissent, nec...ge1·o] Strictly the
sentence ought to be ‘Neither am Ι come except in obedience
to destiny, nor do I wage war with your moes hut in the. first
halfof it virgil has blended two thoughts, (1) ίΙ have not come
except in obedience to destiny‚⁷ and (2) ‘I should not have
come unless destiny had so ordered.' Throughout the Aeneid
Aeneas is the servant of ‘fate’ (cf. 232) ; it was ‘fate' οι· ‘the
decree of heaven’ (falum, cf. sari) that he should found in
Italy a second Troy (130famles murorum moles), and obedience
to his divine destiny is his one rule of conduct.

113. gente] Strongly opposed to reas. ‘ It is not with the
people‚’ he says, ‘I war: it is your king who has abandoned
our ties of hospitality.' Hospitium can be used equally of the

relation of a host to his guest or of a guest to his host ; hence
nostra.

115. aequius...fuerat] ‘it had been fairer that Turnus
should confront this death! The indicative fuerat is idiomatic‚
aequum est being constantly usedz‘it would be rights and
aequum fecit or fuerat ‘it would have been right’; so too
303 melius fecerat ‘it would have been better‚’ polemi, potuit
‘it would have been possil)le‚' operae prelium suit ‘it would
have been worth while‚' debuit, decuit 117, etc„ just: as ἐχρῆν,
