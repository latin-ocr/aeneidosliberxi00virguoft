INTRODUCTION XXV

TO VIRGIL

WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE MANTUANS FOR THE
NINETEENTH CENTENARY OF V1RG1L’S DEATH

1
Roman virgil, thou that singest
Iliou’s lofty temples robed. in fire,

Ilion falling, Rome arising‚
wars, and filial saith, and Dido’s pyre ;

11
Landscapedover, lord of Ianguage
more than he that sang the NVorks and Days,

All the chosen coin of fancy
flashing out from many a golden phrase 3

111

Thou that singest wheat and woodland,
tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd ;

Au the charm of all the Muses
often flowering in a 101]er word ;

lv
Poet of the happy Tityrus
piping underneath his beechen bowers ;

Poet of the poet-satyr
whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers ;

V

Chanter of the Pollio, glorying
in the blissful years again to be,
Summers of the snakeless meadow,
unlaborious earth and oarless sea ;
