his foes and died gloriously (cf. magma tropaea... 177).

169. quin...] ‘Nay Ι myself would hold thee worthy of no
other death thau pious Aeneas...) The full construction would
be quam quo pius Aeneas te (liquatus cst. Quin introduces a
stronger statement3 after saying that his son’s glory ‘shall be
his joy’ he goes farther and says that he could not wish for
him a nobler death than that, the ‘ worth‘ of which Aeneas
and all his host have attested.

170. quam...et quam...et quam] Emphatic repetition,
expressive of the repeated testimony to his worth3 so too in

would, but for Pallas' youth, himself be standing there ‘a
monstrous arm-(lecked trunk.’

177. quod...] ‘whereas I still delay life (i.e. refuse to let it
depart), though hateful now Pallas is slain‚ thy right hand is

cause which thou seest owes....' He only lives to see Aeneas
avenge him and his son on Turnus.

179. meritis...] ‘that only field is (lest) open to thee for thy
