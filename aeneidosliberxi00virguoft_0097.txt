NOTES 65

389. imus in adversos ⁴?] ‘Do we (zare we to 2) advance
against the fer' The indicative is often thus put sor the
deliberative subj. in short questions to give greater life3 cf.
2. 322 quam prendimus arcem? 3. 367 quae prima pericula
vito? ‘am I to shun2' The words here are practically an
invitation, and then Turnus seigns astonishment that it is not
accepted—‘WVhy hesitate 2 or shall thy valour ever be... ’ζ’

392. pulsus ego inpulsum] Indignantly repeating pulsus
from 366. quisquam is used in negative sentences, and so
here because ‘ will any ’ z ‘ no one will.’

393. tumidum...] He refers to his exploits in the late
battle described in Book X., and exaggerates the death of
Pallas as ‘the downfall of Evander's house root and brancli‚’
because by his death the last scion of the race (stirps) had
perished.

395. exutos...] i.e. their spoiled corpses, as though they
were still lying on the field for any one to go and see. Cf. the
curious future videbit, ‘will any one charge me with defeat who
shall see...‚’ as though he invited them to go and see the sight
and then taunt him with cowardice.

396. Bitias et Pandarus] Two Trojan brothers, of giant
size, whom Turnus slew 3 9. 672 seq.

397. mille die] ‘a thousand in (one) day.’ Usually clio
thus used alone=‘a day‚' ‘any day‚’ ‘every day' (6.9. Ecl. 2.
42 bina clia ‘two a day' 3 Hor. Sat. 2. 1. 4), but here it clearly
alludes to the one day when, after slaying Bitias and Pandarus,
he forced his way within the Trojan encampment, found
himself cut off within it from his followers, turned to bay like
a lion, and finally leapt from the walls into the Tibcr and
escaped ; 9. 778 to end.

399. capiti...] ‘Against the Trojan’s head, niadman, and
thy own fortunes chant such strains.' The periphrasis Dar-
‹lam'um capul, =Aeneas, at once expresses hate and contempt
(cf. its use by Dido of Aeneas 4. 640, and the Gk. ὦ στυγνὸν
κάρα), and also a wish that his prophecies os ill may fall on the
head of Aeneas and himself (cf. Ps. vii. 16, 17 ‘upon his own
pate ’). Omnem is commonly used of uttering a prophecy, because
oracles and prophecies were always in verse, but it also suggests
that the saying nulla salios bello is a stale old saw (cantilena).
