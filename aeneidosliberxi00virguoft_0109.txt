NOTES 77

movement, the noise, and the ‘fire' (we should say ‘life’) of
the scene. For ardescit cf. the common use effervere to express
life and bustle.

608. uterque] The singular is curious, for ‘each of two
bodies of men' is um'qae.⁶1³ossi'bly Virs gil means ea ren-itus to
be supplied (cf. mercibus 598), but p1ob tbly uterque: ct T7os
ct Rutulus‘ the T1ojan and the Rutulian,² z. e. the army of eachj.
cf. the common use of Romanus, Poenus, etc., in the singular- -
‘the Romans‚’ ‘the Carthaginians.’

609. furentesque] The line runs over into the next to
mark the onward rush. furentes exhortantur: they no
longer ‘ control their rage‚' but ‘spur it on.’ The phrase is
like currentem incitare, σπεύδοντα ὀτρύνειν.

611. nivis ritu] So Hom. ll. 12. 156 of stones flung from
the ramparts νιφάδες δ’ ὡς πῖπτον ἔραζε. Cf. Scott, Lady of the
Lake 5. 15 ‘Fierce Roderick felt the fartal drain Ι And shower’d
his blows like wintry rain.’ umbra : ‘ the shade’ of the darts
which darken the air. Cf. Herodotus 7. 226, where DieneceS,
one of the three hundred at Thermopylae, being told that the
Persian arrows ‘ hide the sun,' replied that in that case ὑπὸ σκιῇ
ἔσοιτο ἡ μάχη καὶ οὐκ ἐν ἡλίῳ. ¹

613. primique ruinam dant...] ‘and first make onset (or
‘charge') with huge din, as with shattering shock (pmfmcta)
they dash their chargers breast to breast'3 lit. ‘and break
breasts of their chargers with breasts so that there 15 a shatter-
ing.’ All editors explain that both horsemen are overthrown
and both horses killed, but dant ruinam is merelyzrumzt (cf.
dare sonitumzsonare), and, though it may mean ‘cause over-
throw,' need not do so. Nor need perfracta. ‘rzwnpunt be:
pmfringyunt et rumpunt (Conington), as though the horses’
hreasts were actually ‘burst' and ‘broken’3 it may equally
well mean that the riders dash their horses together with such

violence as naturally to cause this result. The αείῑιαῖ result of ’

the charge is only described in the following words, ‘da-shcd
from his steed like a thunderbolt...Aconteus is flung far and
scatters his life into the air.' If Tyrrhenus is overthrown too
and his horse killed, the special mention of Aconteus is remark-
able and the terror of the Latius unaccountable. It is absolutely
necessary to picture to ourselves Tyrrhenus as triumphant, and
not as lying on the ground and possibly just alive.

617. vitam...] ‘life’ is regularly regarded as ‘breath‚' and
