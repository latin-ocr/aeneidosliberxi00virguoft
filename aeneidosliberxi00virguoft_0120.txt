790. omnipotens] Emphatie at the end3 ⁵(for thou art)
almighty.’ The adj. could not be applied to the ordinary
Apollo, for Jupiter only is ‘almighty‚' but to Arruns the Apollo
of Soracte is the chief deity (cf. above summe deam and quem
primi colimus).

792. haec...] ‘so but (dam with subj.) this cursed plague
fall defeated by my weapon, Ι will (be content to) return in-
glorious to my country's cities.' He is not actually ‘inglorious ’
(cf. mihi cetera laudem lfactaferent), but he is content not to
claim the further glory of this exploit; he only wishes to
achieve the result, and does not care for the same of it.

794. audiit,..] ‘ Phoebus heard, and in his purpose granted
that part of the prayer should prosper, part he scattered on the
swift breezes ; that he should slay...he assented, that his country
should see his return he did not grant. ...’ The prayer for his
return had not been actually expressed by Arruns, but is im-
plied in remeabo 793. The idea is from Hom. Il. 16. 250—

τῷ δ’ ἕτερον μὲν ἔδωκε πατήρ, ἕτερον δ’ ἀνένευσε·
νηῶν μέν οἱ ἀπώσασθαι πόλεμόν τε μάχην τε
δῶκε, σόον δ’ ἀνένευσε μάχης ἐξ ἀπονέεσθαι.

To ‘give to the winds’ is regular in the sense of make vain;

797. alta] Probably merely ‘nobles ef. 10. 374 ; though
some find a reference to Mount Soracte=‘his country's heights.’

801. ipsa] ‘she herself ' emphatic. While all others noted
the spear, ⁴ she herself was mindsul neither of air nor sound nor
shast.’ Aurae is used with reference to per Hiems 799, cf. 863
aurasque sonantes ; the weapon causes an audible rush and whirl
of air.

804. haesit] Sidgwick rightly notes that the spondee and
pause ‘suggest the thing described: bibit cruorem: cf.
{iffi} ἐίἓέἕ ,of the Lake 5. 15 ‘And thrice the Saxon blade ἱ

807. laetitia...] ‘in mingled joy and sear.’ Hence eaeterritus
in ‘the preceding line is rather ‘dazed‚’ ‘amazedjfthan ‘terri-
fied’ ; the deed when done astounds his puny spirit, cf. 812.

809. ae velut ille.‚.] ‘and as, look you, before hostile darts
can pursue him, after slaying some shepherd, a wolf has straight-
way hidden himself...even so (814) Arruns. ...’ ille anticipates
