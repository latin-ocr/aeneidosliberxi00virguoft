70 VERGILI AENEIDOS XI

47 6. labor ultimus] ‘ the last struggle.’ omnes : emphatic.

477. arces] The temple is supposed to be on a height.
So iu Hom. ll. 6. 297—a passage which virgil imitates—the
temple of Athene, to which Hecuba carries gifts‚ praying her
to slay Diomede (cf. below 484), is ἐν πόλει ἄκρῃ. Cf. too the
temples on the Acropolis at Athens.

478. subvehitur] ‘ rides up’ ; in sacred procession the Roman
matrons rode in four-wheeled carriages called pilenta (cf. 8. 665
castae ducebant sacra per urbem l pilentis matres in mollibus).

480. tanti, oculos] Hiatus helped by the pause. oculos
deiecta... : ‘her graceful eyes downeast.’ In cases like this the
acc. used to be described as one of respect, ‘ cast down as to her
eyes,' but the participle has really a middle force, ‘ having her
eyes downcast,’ and governs the accusative. Cf. 121, 649.

481. ture vaporant] ‘fill with the smoke of incense.’

482. et maestas...] Note the melancholy spondees. alto
de limine : the temple would be approached by a flight of steps
which the ‘matrons ascend‚’ and then ‘ from the lofty threshold ’
begin to offer incense and prayer. Conington explains limine
as the door of the cella or inner shrine (and if so succedunt
must be taken not=‘ascend ' but ‘enter’ the temple); this,
however, is inconsistent with alto.

484. frange manu] ‘break with ‘chy hand’ ; mann
emphasises the persona] interposition of the goddess, cf. 453 n.
Cf. Hom. Il. 6. 306 ἆξον δὴ ἔγχος Διομήδεος, ἠδὲ καὶ αὐτὸν Ι πρηνέα
δὸς πεσέειν Σκαιῶν προπάροιθε πυλάων.

486-531. Turnus arms and vts lrarryzbzgy to the comhat, exult-
ant as a steed that llas broken Zoose from its stall, when Camilla
meets him and offers to attach· the Trojan cavalry while he yaards
tlte town. He tells her that tlte cavalry are only intended
to maslc tlte advanee of Aeneas witlz- nis main force over the
mountains; lm therefore bias her enyagye them while lie prepares
an amb'aslt ‘z'n the mountain-pass ὁρ] which Aeneas will come.

486. cingitur in proelia] ‘gii-ds himself for the fray’;
elsewhere ferrum einyz'tnr (2. 510), cinyi telis (2. 520), and
below 536 ctngyz'tim· armis, but here the addition of in proelia
makes the mention of ‘arnis’ uunecessary. certatim ε ‘ with
emulous haste ⁷ 3 he wished no one to be before him.

487. iamque adeo] ‘ and now indeed ’ ; adeo marks iamque ,
as introducing the beginning of an important narrative 3 of. 314 n.
