alliteration of the line. mori pro moenibus: some compare
the well-known pro patria mori and explain to ‘ die for (ie. in
defence os) their walls,' but though ‘to die for country' is a
good phrase, ‘ to die for walls’ is less su, and pro should clearly
be taken iu a local sense ‘ to die in foremost place out upon the
walls ’ (sur les muraz'lles et tournees vers l'ennemi, Benoist).
