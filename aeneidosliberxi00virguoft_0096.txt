64 VERGILI AENEIDOS XI

375. qui vocat] The Aeneid was unfinished and contains
many ineomplete lines, which Vi1gil is said to have left until
he could ievise it, but some of them would be very difficult to
complete. So here qut vocat is flung in the face of Turnus
with such diamatic effect that no addition could' improve it.

376—444. Turnus cmswers with jury .· ‘ Thy words are
valiant, Drances ,· the enemy are close at hamt, come with me to
battle! What? 13 thy bravery only in thy conque, and dost
thoze moeh· me whose eteeds spealc for me? Or z's there indeed ow
hope iot war ayaz‘nst these tzotee beaten stranyers? Nay, Latinus,
if in tritth one reverse, one refusal of help, cannot be repaired,
then Zet us prayfor peace, thoussh death were happier,· but is we
have still strengylh, stell stoue celtes, Zet us hope for happier
fortune, or, if Aeneas challenqes me alone, then, whether death
or (story wait me, I accept)

377. rumpitque...] ‘lie makes these words burst...'; we

say ‘these words burst’3 rumpit suggests the outbreak of
repressed passion.

‘to boast.’ dum: ‘so long as,’ emphatic. He can talk
‘ while’ there is a stout wall between him and the foe.

382. agger murorum] The (19961- 111 a emnp was the bank
of earth which surrounded it, but here (and 10. 24) the word
z‘mass,' ‘pile' The double phrase emphasises the sense
of seeurity. fossae z the moat or trench outside the wall.

383. proinde...] ‘thunder on then with eloquence after thy
wont.’ Proinde is contemptuous, as 111 line 400, just as we say
to a person ‘Oh‚ go on!’ solitum is probably cogn. aee.
(‘thunde1· thy usual thunder ¹):an adverb, ef. 62 11 ς or solitum
tibi may be taken as a parenthesis:solitum est tibi, ‘’t is thy
wont.
